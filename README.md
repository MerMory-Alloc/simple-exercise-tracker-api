# Exercice Tracker Api

The provided code implements a basic Express.js server for an exercise tracker API. The server includes endpoints for creating users, retrieving all users, and adding exercises to a user's log. MongoDB is utilized as the database to store user information and exercise logs. The user schema has been extended to include an array of exercises, and additional endpoints support querying exercise logs with optional filters for date range and result limits.

This project serves as one of the required projects for the FreeCodeCamp course "Back End Development and APIs" certification. It demonstrates fundamental concepts in building back-end applications, including handling HTTP requests, interacting with a database (MongoDB in this case), and implementing RESTful API endpoints for user and exercise management.
